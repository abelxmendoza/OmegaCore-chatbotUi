# Remove Template Status from GitHub Repository

Your repository is currently showing as a "public template" because it was forked from Vercel's template repository. Here's how to remove that:

## Steps to Remove Template Status

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub:**
   - https://github.com/abelxmendoza/OmegaCore-chatbotUi

2. **Click on "Settings"** (gear icon in the top right of the repository page)

3. **Scroll down to "Template repository" section**
   - This is usually near the bottom of the General settings page

4. **Uncheck the checkbox** that says:
   - ☑ "Template repository" 
   - (Make sure it's unchecked/empty)

5. **Click "Save" or the update button**

## Alternative: If you don't see "Template repository" option

If the template option isn't visible, it might be because:
- The repository was created as a template initially
- You may need to go to: Settings → General → Scroll to bottom

## After Removing Template Status

Once you uncheck the template repository option:
- Your repo will no longer show the "Use this template" button
- It will be a regular public repository
- People can still fork it normally, but it won't be presented as a template

## Note

If you want to keep it as a template (for others to use), you can leave it checked. But if you want it to be your own project (not a template), uncheck it.
